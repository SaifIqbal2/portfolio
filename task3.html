    <h1>Task 3 – Summary of Virtual Collaboration</h1>

      <summary>Virtual Collaboration Summary</summary>
      <div class="content">
        <article class="card">
          <p>Virtual collaboration is the coordinated work of people who are not co‑located, using digital tools and agreed working practices to achieve shared outcomes. Distance changes how teams build trust, share context and resolve ambiguity, so teams must compensate with explicit communication and visible artifacts. Research on distributed work highlights that “distance matters” because it increases coordination costs and reduces the informal cues that normally help teams stay aligned [1]. For this reason, effective virtual collaboration balances synchronous touchpoints (to align goals and resolve blockers) with asynchronous workflows (to protect focus time and enable time‑zone flexibility).</p>
          <p>Good practice starts with clarity: shared objectives, role expectations and a single source of truth for decisions. Teams improve reliability by using structured agendas, action logs and lightweight documentation that captures what was decided, by whom, and why. These habits reduce rework and help onboard new members faster because knowledge is searchable rather than trapped in meetings. Workforce guidance also notes that adaptability, communication and collaboration remain critical as digital work increases, meaning technical tools must be matched with strong “human” skills to sustain performance under change [2].</p>
          <p>Tool choice should fit the task. Chat and discussion boards are effective for quick questions and updates, while shared documents and versioning support co‑authoring and accountability. Video meetings are valuable for sense‑making and relationship building, but should be used intentionally to avoid “meeting overload”. A practical way to implement this is to write a short collaboration agreement that defines response time expectations, when to use each channel, file naming conventions, and how decisions are recorded. E‑portfolio guidance similarly emphasises organising evidence clearly and making learning visible through structured reflection and artifacts, which translates directly into better collaboration documentation [3].</p>
          <p>Finally, inclusive practice strengthens virtual teams. Providing accessible formats (clear headings, readable layouts, and where appropriate, captions or summaries) broadens participation and creates reusable learning resources. Overall, strong virtual collaboration is not about using more tools; it is about using a small set of tools consistently, with clear norms, and reviewing what works through retrospectives and evidence‑based improvements [1]–[3].</p>

            <h2>Automatic Referencing Tool: RefWorks</h2>
            <p>Using RefWorks, I created a project folder for this assignment, imported sources via DOI/URL, and selected the IEEE output style. I inserted in‑text citations and generated reference lists for each task page. I verified fields such as author order, title case and year, and corrected metadata where web imports were incomplete, which is important because automatic imports often miss corporate authors or publication dates [4]. Screenshots below illustrate the workflow.</p>

            <h2>Explanation</h2>
            <p>I used RefWorks to manage references consistently. After creating a dedicated folder, I added items via DOI and direct URL, then checked imported metadata for accuracy. I set the output style to IEEE and used the “Create Bibliography” feature to generate task‑level lists. For in‑text citations, I copied numbered references into the relevant paragraphs, ensuring order of appearance matched IEEE conventions. Before export, I standardised author initials, publication years and publisher fields. This workflow reduced errors and time spent formatting, while making it easy to reuse sources across tasks.</p>
